  				<p>January 31 2021 part 1</p>
  				I know this is late to start this journal as I already have most of the basics of the website done but i am starting it now. I thought it would be cool to do post it notes in a sort of table. Today I did this and added music to all the pages so all you have to do it click to hear the song and click again to pause. This is a little much for one post-it so on to the next one.  The songs as a key: the main page is the SVU theme for my SVU themed website. the About me is daughter. The projects page is Silence and this page, my journal is cinderella. I need to also figre out how to limit the amount of space on top so I can write more on one post it. So for next time: limit top space on post-it , and make mock-up and maybe start the mock up for my first project. Shhhhhh... its an SVU chacter board.

          Today I tried to uplaod my website to github but it did not really work, I will trouble shoot during my lab on friday. Next up for monday I am creating a mock up for the Charecter chart and then I am going to try to code at least one chacter in and hopefully two to three. I finished the post-its, they look really cool. But that's it for today, not much more has happened. This will be quick I just wanted to say that I made my projects page look good, now all I need to do it atuually make projects and put them in

  				It has been a while scine ai really sat down and worked today I am starting the basics of my first offical code sketch. It is a chareter web of all the svu charecters. I dont know if this is even possible but I want to formant them in a circle eventually but for now I am just trying to get all the photos in. Okay so it is later in the day and i have done more. all of the detective photos are offically in and formatted to size but trying to get them in. circle is hard and google is not much help. I think the only way to do it is the long annoying way but I don't know. We will seee how this turns out, it is a bit of a challenge for the first code sketch but I mean I like the challenge.

          So a lot has happened. Every person has music. It is about time. You can now scroll on the post-its so no more part twos. I figured out how to make the information apear on click of a person. So now the goal is to make every div apear on click and disapear and then right up each person's blurbs and then on to the lines and I am done. this has been a hard project but I like the way it is going so i like it. It is later in the day now so here is an update. Everyone has apearing and disapearing divs. Now I need to write up each persons blurb and make there conections and then it should be done. This is exciting. It is really coming together.
