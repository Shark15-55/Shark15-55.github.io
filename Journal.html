  				I know this is late to start this journal as I already have most of the basics of the website done but i am starting it now. I thought it would be cool to do post it notes in a sort of table. Today I did this and added music to all the pages so all you have to do it click to hear the song and click again to pause. This is a little much for one post-it so on to the next one.

  				The songs as a key: the main page is the SVU theme for my SVU themed website. the About me is daughter. The projects page is Silence and this page, my journal is cinderella. I need to also figre out how to limit the amount of space on top so I can write more on one post it. So for next time: limit top space on post-it , and make mock-up and maybe start the mock up for my first project. Shhhhhh... its an SVU chacter board.

  				Today I tried to uplaod my website to github but it did not really work, I will trouble shoot during my lab on friday. Next up for monday I am creating a mock up for the Charecter chart and then I am going to try to code at least one chacter in and hopefully two to three. I finished the post-its, they look really cool. But that's it for today, not much more has happened.

          Okay so it is later in the day and i have done more. all of the detective photos are offically in and formatted to size but trying to get them in. circle is hard and google is not much help. I think the only way to do it is the long annoying way but I don't know. We will seee how this turns out, it is a bit of a challenge for the first code sketch but I mean I like the challenge.
