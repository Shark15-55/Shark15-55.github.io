  				I know this is late to start this journal as I already have most of the basics of the website done but i am starting it now. I thought it would be cool to do post it notes in a sort of table. Today I did this and added music to all the pages so all you have to do it click to hear the song and click again to pause. This is a little much for one post-it so on to the next one.  The songs as a key: the main page is the SVU theme for my SVU themed website. the About me is daughter. The projects page is Silence and this page, my journal is cinderella. I need to also figre out how to limit the amount of space on top so I can write more on one post it. So for next time: limit top space on post-it , and make mock-up and maybe start the mock up for my first project. Shhhhhh... its an SVU chacter board.

          Today I tried to uplaod my website to github but it did not really work, I will trouble shoot during my lab on friday. Next up for monday I am creating a mock up for the Charecter chart and then I am going to try to code at least one chacter in and hopefully two to three. I finished the post-its, they look really cool. But that's it for today, not much more has happened. This will be quick I just wanted to say that I made my projects page look good, now all I need to do it atuually make projects and put them in

  				It has been a while scine ai really sat down and worked today I am starting the basics of my first offical code sketch. It is a chareter web of all the svu charecters. I dont know if this is even possible but I want to formant them in a circle eventually but for now I am just trying to get all the photos in. Okay so it is later in the day and i have done more. all of the detective photos are offically in and formatted to size but trying to get them in. circle is hard and google is not much help. I think the only way to do it is the long annoying way but I don't know. We will seee how this turns out, it is a bit of a challenge for the first code sketch but I mean I like the challenge.

          So a lot has happened. Every person has music. It is about time. You can now scroll on the post-its so no more part twos. I figured out how to make the information apear on click of a person. So now the goal is to make every div apear on click and disapear and then right up each person's blurbs and then on to the lines and I am done. this has been a hard project but I like the way it is going so i like it. It is later in the day now so here is an update. Everyone has apearing and disapearing divs. Now I need to write up each persons blurb and make there conections and then it should be done. This is exciting. It is really coming together.

          I keep meaning to update this and forgeting but today I finished all the code for my first code sketch so this is very exciting. Now all i need to do is fiish the info oin each person but that is just writing no coding. it is very cool that I finished everything because it took so long. I was to do something either with the adas or a season guesser soon but For now I am just admiring the thing I have spent houra on Hour on hours creating. i dont know what I am going to procrastinate with now because noramlly this is all I am ever doing. Better start working on my next code sketch.

          So I have started really making my next codesketc but I am on a plane so there are a couple things I wioll need to look up when I land. They include how tomakethe border of a table show and _________. I also need to make a go home button on the new code sketch. For skills I know I am feeling veruy solid in varibles and lay outs and making things do stuff on click but dragging and making the computer check if what was put in is right will be more of a challenge.

          I have three requirments for class. Make a codesketch with animation. Which is going to come at the end of the season matcer which i am working on now. Make someting with an array which I am making a favorite episode randomizer that will hold all of my favorite episodes so you can learn about them and watch them if you want. ANd then as of now the last thing is something with a for loop but I have no Idea how to do that. Along with though not requried I do need to figure out how to make a drag and drop thing and check values. That is a lot of work cut out for me but I think I got this. I also need to figure out ow to get my website on my oter computer and push it from there because one of my codes in on there. But those are my plans for now. I think the for loop thing I might do with detective badges or something like that.

  				I'm still trying to get the drag and drop to work but I still donmt really understand what is happening. I also want to finish the season mathcer this week. Never mind I got te gdrag to work. Now i just have to make it work with every single photo not just the one. So Update all drag and drop works except of season 11,12 and 14 for somereason adn i still need to put in season 15-22 and see if those work. So I am going to put in the rest of them and then trouble shoot. I tak eback the update you just need to amke sure you are dragging from the center of the image and it might take a couple trys.
